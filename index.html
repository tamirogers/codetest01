    <h3>AngularJS Questions</h3>
    <p>
        How do you define an AngularJS application? Angular is the framework behind the app, client side, providing struture. Makes for more declarative programming where you have more control.
        <div>
            What is a controller? This holds all of the logic that tells our app how to behave. It's the only piece communicating to the server, and also is directly communicating to the model. The view can also reach the controller.
        </div>
        <div>
            What does ng-model do? This is a directive in the html that updates the scope in real time. It needs to connect the view to the model.
        </div>
        <div>
            What is interpolation markup? This is the text or value embedded in an expression, that is binded back to scope, so it can update the model.
        </div>
        <div>
            What is $scope? It sits between the model and the view and collects changes to update in either direction.
        </div>
        <div>
            What is dependency injection? Dependancies are injected when they will be used in the controller, like http, and also inject in the factory. They are services, and I think also objects.
        </div>
        <div>
            What is two-way binding? The ng-model connects binding of data going to and from the view and model.
        </div>
        <div>
            What is 'controller as' syntax? Not sure about this one, I think this is where you can use vm. -Like when you put in ng-controller in html, you add "someName as vm".
        </div>
        <div>
            What is MV* architecture? This is an alternate to MVC (model view controller), sometimes referred to as whatever or MVVM. It sort of takes the controller out of the picture and replaces it with a ViewModel, so the view is no longer communicating with the model.
        </div>
        <div>
            What is the difference between a service and a factory? The factory is where you call an API service, call for a document, etc. Services run from the controller to the model. The factory is in itself a service that gets injected to the controller.
